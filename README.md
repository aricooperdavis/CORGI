CORGI: Circular Orienteering Route Generation Interface

This is a locally hosted python/flask app that allows you to automatically generate circular orienteering routes, then visualise those routes on a folium map in your browser. Customise the number of points, and the distance between them, by modifying the parameters in `corgi.py` and disable snapping to OSM features if you're orienteering in a wild area.
